# HxDev Neovim

My Neovim configuration that I use reqularly for programming.


## Prerequisites

- Neovim >= 0.8.0 (version 0.8.0 or newer)
- a Nerd Font ([Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com))
- a modern terminal emulator like [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)(Recommended) or [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- `fd` and `ripgrep` programs used for `Telescope.nvim` plugin for fuzzy finding.

NOTE: It's better to setup **TokyoNight** colorscheme for your terminal emulator. Because i'm using TokyoNight colorscheme
for this configuration.


## How to setup

After you have all the prerequisites, it's time to setup Neovim.


1. If you already have a configuration for Neovim make a backup:
```bash
# make a .tar.gz archive file from old configurations to ~/nvim-backup.tar.gz
tar xzvf ~/nvim-backup.tar.gz ~/.config/nvim

# remove old configs and also old Neovim data
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```


2. Clone this configuration
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/thehxdev/nvimdots ~/.config/nvim
```


3. Enter to Neovim with `nvim` command and wait to `lazy.nvim` plugin install itself.


## Features

NOTE: I'm using this configuration on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). To setup LSP support for your language, you must
do some manual work.

- Plugin Management with [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- LSP support for every language that Neovim supportes (Manual Setup)
- LSP Diagnostics report and IDE like features
    - [Which languages supported by Neovim's LSP?](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md)
    - Edit [lspconf.lua](https://github.com/thehxdev/nvimdots/blob/main/lua/lspconf.lua) file and uncomment pre-configured LSPs.
- Auto completions using [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)
- Tree-Sitter syntax highliting
- File navigation with NeoTree (Integrated with Git)
- Fuzzy finder ([Telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim))
- Complete Git integration with [Gitsigns](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)
- Show help messege with prefixed keymaps with [whichkey](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim)


## LSP

Neovim LSP Documentation.

### Q&A

- [Which languages supported by Neovim's LSP?](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md)

### How to configure a programming language's LSP server?

1. First visit [Server Configurations](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) and install proper LSP server.

2. If you already installed LSP server, open [lspconf.lua](https://github.com/thehxdev/nvimdots/blob/main/lua/lspconf.lua) with Neovim.
Try to find your programming language and uncomment the code block that configures that language's LSP.

3. If your language or LSP server not found in `lspoconf.lua`. follow guids in [Server Configurations](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md).
